# Changelog

All notable changes to **Litecord** will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v0.3.9] - 2026-08-29

### 🎨 UI & Design Fixes
- **Unified Vector SVG Collapse Chevrons (`chevron-down.svg`, `chevron-right.svg`, `chevron-up.svg`)**:
  - Replaced system Unicode arrows (`▸` / `▾` / `▼`) with crisp SVG vector icons for categories and message links.
  - Fixes missing font glyph boxes (`□`) on Windows systems and provides smooth color transitions across all platforms.
- **Fixed Chat Header Channel Title Duplication**:
  - Sanitized active channel name formatting to prevent duplicate hashtag prefixing (`## channel` -> `# channel`).

### 📦 Windows Installer & Updater
- **Automated Restart & Installer Relaunch**:
  - Removed `skipifsilent` flag in Inno Setup (`installer.iss`), ensuring the installer launches `litecord.exe` immediately after installation and in-app updates.

## [v0.3.8] - 2026-08-29

### 🛡️ Security & Token Hardening
- **Linux Encrypted Token Vault (`~/.config/litecord/session.vault`)**:
  - Implemented secure credential storage on Linux strictly following the XDG Base Directory specification.
  - Directories are created with `0700` and vault files with `0600` (exclusive user read/write access).
  - Credentials are encrypted at rest with **AES-256-GCM** using keys derived from `/etc/machine-id` and the user's UID (preventing token theft even if storage files are exfiltrated).
  - Seamless automatic migration from legacy `.litecord_token` files.
- **Windows DPAPI Vault Alignment**:
  - Encrypted tokens on Windows are now stored in `%APPDATA%/Litecord/session.vault` using Windows DPAPI (`CryptProtectData`).
- **P2P Video Streaming Cryptographic Authentication**:
  - Derived AES-256-GCM E2EE keys now mix Discord's authenticated `voice_secret_key` (negotiated via Voice Gateway Opcode 4).
  - Anonymous MQTT signaling topics are derived using SHA-256 hashes of the authenticated session key, ensuring only verified participants in the voice room can discover or decrypt screen share streams.
- **Strict Log Sanitization**:
  - Removed all token and session key prefixes from console and file logs (`litecord_app.log`).
- **Atomic Logout Credential Cleanup**:
  - Centralized `delete_secure_token()` handler to guarantee zero residual credentials on user sign-out.

### 🖥️ UI & Popout Window Improvements
- **Popout Window Responsive Controls Hierarchy**:
  - Decreased minimum window resize limits down to **180px × 120px** (mini Picture-in-Picture mode).
  - Implemented progressive hiding order as the window is shrunk:
    1. Volume slider (hides when width <= 420px).
    2. "AO VIVO" Live Badge (hides when width <= 340px).
    3. FPS Counter Badge (hides when width <= 270px).
    4. Username (hides when width <= 200px).
    5. Action control buttons (Ghost mode, Pin, Minimize, Maximize, Close) remain **100% visible and accessible**.
- **Embedded Video Card Dynamic Expansion**:
  - Clicking maximize/focus on the embedded stream card in a voice room now dynamically expands the video container to fill all available viewport height and width (`stage_height - 52px`) with zero clipping or overflow.
- **Main Window Maximize/Restore Button Toggle**:
  - Synchronized `is_maximized` state between the window manager and titlebar.
  - The maximize icon dynamically toggles between single square (`chrome-maximize.svg`) and restore double-square (`chrome-restore.svg`).

### ⚡ Portability & Robustness
- **Static CRT on Windows (`+crt-static`)**:
  - Windows release builds now statically link the C runtime (`target-feature=+crt-static`), allowing Litecord to run immediately on fresh Windows installs and VMs without requiring the Visual C++ Redistributable (`vcruntime140.dll`).
- **Automatic Software Renderer Fallback**:
  - Added automatic detection and fallback to Slint software renderer (`SLINT_BACKEND=software`) when hardware OpenGL/GPU drivers fail to initialize (common in Virtual Machines and RDP sessions).
